I'm Audrey, a doctoral student at the University of Michigan studying auditory neuroscience. I completed my undergraduate degrees at Michigan State University in Neuroscience (B.S.) and Music (B.A.) where I studied how music training influences speech perception, particularly in older adults with sensorineural hearing loss, and investigated in the neural mechanisms of entrainment related to speech understanding. 

In my Ph.D. program, I've continued this research by using looking at differences in beat perception in adults who stutter. Additionally, I'm interested in the neural circuitry that underlies the perception of frequency in sounds, which are particularly important in speech. To investigate this, I've used a mouse model to study cell type specific responses in the brainstem. 

Outside of academics, I enjoy backpacking & hiking, reading, and spending time with my dog, Mo.
